## Feature

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these 
goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. 
To get Even more out of these examples, don't forget to install Rust locally and check out the official docs. 
Additionally for the curious, you can also check out the source code for this site.
