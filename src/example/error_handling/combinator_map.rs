// `map` is a valid method of handling Options. However, you may eventually find heavy usage tedious,
// especially with operations only valid with an input. In these cases, combinators can be used to
// manage control flow in a modular fashion.
// `Option` has a built in method called map(), a combinator for the simple mapping of Some -> Some
// and None -> None. Multiple map() calls can be chained together for even more flexibility.

// In the following example, process() replaces all functions previous to it while staying compact.
